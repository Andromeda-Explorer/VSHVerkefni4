      World of Wine isn't just a restaurant, we offer a 3 week course where you will learn everything that there is to know about wine. The history, how it's made, the difference between grape varieties, food pairing and more. At the end of the course you will have everything you need to be able to bring a variety of knowledge to the dinner table and talk about wine like some do about certain sports. The 3 week introduction is one of five steps that we offer and it is a great way to get anybody who is interested in wine but scared to enter the first steps into this often misunderstood snobby world and create an enviromente that feels comfortable and where you will have fun learning. 
        </p>
        <p>
      We also offer wine tastings, where a group of maximum 10 people gather to discover different types of wines and how they pair with top quality cheeses and meats from all around the world. Our 3 star kitchen provides world class food that will get your tastebuds to explode with joy. A perfect occasion for friend groups, bachelor parties, date nights or for your colleagues to create a happy work relationship. The tasting takes approximately 3-5 hours and our live jazz band will play all night long to entertain the group. The tasting directors are fun spirits who you will hopefully never forget and they will make you feel comfortable and at home during the tasting.

        <h2 id="w-h2">About</h2>
        <p>
      World of Wine is a three Michelin star restaurant that opened in 2004 by Thomas Ari Plank and its primary focus is on food and wine pairing dishes. Over the years we have attained a wine cellar that holds bottles from around the world and in our collection we have wine bottles that go for around 12.000$. Our doors are welcome to anybody who wants to learn about the world of wine. Our teachers are experts in the field and have both worked and taught the subject for many decades. You don't have to know anything about wine before taking part in the course and it is encouraged to ask question like "Why is wine such a big deal, isn't it at its core just fermented grape juice?" 
        </p>
        <p>
      World of Wine has gladly accepted a wide arange of awards from many culunary institutions and it was just last year(2015) that World of Wine was awarded it's third Michelin star, having previously held two. Our kitchen is very proud to serve simple yet elegant food. Our cuisine is mostly italian based and we have a crew of 22 people serving every night some of the best food that you can find in Europe. We are known for many things but the incident that we are most famous for was when U.S president Barack Obama dined at our restaurant and later in a interview said after being asked about his dining experience quote "That shit was legit."

      Our documentary "The wine effect" is now available for download and showcases the restaurants history and how it has built itself into a three Michelin star restaurant.
